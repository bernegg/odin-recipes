# odin-recipes

This project is the result of the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes">Project: Recipes</a> section of The Odin Project. It consists of recipes for various food, including the ingredients and steps necessary.

Demonstrated in this repository is the usage of HTML lists, links, images, and paragraphs.

This project was tedious but fun, and was a good way of showcasing the lessons learned in the HTML Foundations part of the course. The hardest part was using Git and creating good commit messages. I do not consider myself a master at Git, but can confidently say that I've improved since I've started learning it.
